    description: 'Dependency-Track is an intelligent Software Supply Chain Component
      Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk from
      the use of third-party and open source components. Dependency-Track takes a
      unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of Software
      Bill-of-Materials (SBOM). This approach provides capabilities that traditional
      Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve. '
